### NLP - Natural Language Processing.

Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages.



### Amazon Comprehend.

Amazon Comprehend is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in unstructured data. 
The service can identify critical elements in data, including references to language, people, and places,and the text files can be categorized by relevant topics. 

Comprehend not only locates any content that contains personally identifiable information, it also redacts and masks those content.


### Boto3

Boto3 is AWS SDK for python. Boto3 makes it easy to integrate our Python application, library, or script with AWS services. The SDK provides an object-oriented API as well as low-level access to AWS services.


### Topic modeling
A topic model is a form of statistical model used in machine learning and natural language processing to find abstract "topics" that appear in a collection of documents.
Topic Modeling is an unsupervised learning method for clustering documents and identifying topics based on their contents. It works in the same way as the K-Means algorithm and Expectation-Maximization. We will have to evaluate individual words in each document to uncover topics and assign values to each depending on the distribution of these terms because we are clustering texts
